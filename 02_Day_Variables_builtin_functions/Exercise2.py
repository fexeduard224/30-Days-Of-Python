#EXERCISE 2



#1 Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
print(type(country))
print(type(age))
print(type(married))

#2 Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
print(len(first_name))
#3 Compare the length of your first name and your last name
print(f'first name length: {len(first_name)}')
print(f'Last name length: {len(last_name)}')
#4 Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
num_one = 5

num_two = 2
# Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
print(num_one + num_two)
    # Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
print(num_one - num_two)
    # Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
print(num_one * num_two)    
    # Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
print(num_one / num_two)
    # Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
print(num_one % num_two)
    # Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
print(num_one ** num_two)   
    # Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
print(num_one // num_two)

#The radius of a circle is 30 meters.

radius_circle = 30

#Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle

area = 3.14 * radius_circle**2
print(area)
#Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
circumference = 3.14*radius_circle
print(circumference)
#Take radius as user input and calculate the area.

radius_circle_2 = input(int)

area_2 = 3.14 * radius_circle_2 **2

print(area_2)
